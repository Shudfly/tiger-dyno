 Flexible bot for Discord, easily customizable and functional
## How to use
**For if you are going to fork this bot, do NOT
run this exact code as a separate bot**

Go to [Discord dev portal](https.discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and create your application. Then, go to the 'Bot' tab and add a bot user. Click to reveal your token.

Then, download the latest version of node.js and NPM, and (in this cloned folder) run `npm install`. Once that is done, create a file in this folder called  `token.txt` and put the only contents of the file as
the token of your bot.

Finally, run `node main.js` in this cloned folder. Your bot should be online, as long as your forked code works.
